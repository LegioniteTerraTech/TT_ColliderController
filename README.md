# TT_ColliderController
(TTMM still borked on this idk why)
Version 0.8

Control colliders of Techs to greatly reduce lag when they are idle in the world.  
Mostly intended for huge artbuilds.  Will re-enable colliders in combat or collision cases.
Will not affect blocks that rely on collision to function.

Press ']' to enable the UI switches to toggle colliders.
Requires Nuterra.NativeOptions to rebind keys.
Supports Control Blocks.

Note: Disabling colliders yields greatly increased frames on large to huge builds (250+ Blocks) but will leave you vulnerable to fast ground collisions

MT- related parts like the platforms, bearings, ETC along with the MotionBlocks grip pads are left untouched to let them do their job.
