# TT_ColliderController
Version 0.8

Control colliders of Techs to greatly reduce lag when they are idle in the world.  
Mostly intended for huge artbuilds.  Will re-enable colliders in combat or collision cases.
Will not affect blocks that rely on collision to function.

Press ']' to enable the UI switches to toggle colliders.
Requires Nuterra.NativeOptions to rebind keys.
Supports Control Blocks.

Note: Disabling colliders yields greatly increased frames on large to huge builds (250+ Blocks) but will leave you vulnerable to fast ground collisions

MT- related parts like the platforms, bearings, ETC along with the MotionBlocks grip pads are left untouched to let them do their job.
